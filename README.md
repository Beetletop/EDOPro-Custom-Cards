# EDOPro-Custom-Cards
My repository for custom cards I programmed for EDOPro

Card images and effects belong to their original owners.  
Not all effects may be working correctly and some may be missing, if you find an issue please report if possible.  
If you do not want your cards on this database you can message me to have them removed.
